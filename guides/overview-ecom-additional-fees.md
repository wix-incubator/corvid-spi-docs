# eCommerce Additional Fees
  
>This SPI is in beta and is subject to change. Some SPIs currently aren't available to all users.

Add additional fee calculations that don't come natively with Wix into your eCommerce checkout flow. This allows you to change how apps, such as Wix Stores and Wix Bookings, calculate charges during checkout. Examples of additional fees are surcharges based on customer location, special handling during shipping, or gift wrapping.
