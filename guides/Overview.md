# Introduction

Velo SPIs (Service Provider Interfaces) provide you with a powerful way to extend Velo’s functionality so that you can:

+ **Inject your own custom logic into existing app flows**

   With the Velo Custom Extension feature and its SPIs, you don't have to code a new flow from beginning to end if you want to customize and extend just one part of an existing app's flow. You can implement the code just for the customized part.

   For example, the out-of-the-box eCommerce checkout flow calculates the total charge for an order based on its line items. With Velo's [Additional Fees](/spis/wix-ecom/ecom-additional-fees) SPI, you can inject the ability to add additional fees that apply to the entire order. Examples of additional fees include fees for fragile items or surcharges for deliveries outside your regular delivery area.

+ **Integrate external services with your Wix site**

  Use the SPIs to integrate with 3rd-party services so that your Wix site and the external services can communicate seamlessly. 
  Some SPIs both facilitate integration and allow flow customization/extension using the Custom Extensions feature, such as [Additional Fees](/spis/wix-ecom/ecom-additional-fees) mentioned above.
  Others simply facilitate integration, such as [Site Monitoring](/spis/getting-started/site-monitoring) and [External Database Collections](/spis/getting-started/external-database-collections).

## Before you begin
It’s important to note the following points before starting to code:

* The Custom Extensions feature is currently in beta and is subject to change. Some custom extensions aren't yet available to all users.

* When integrating with an external service, you'll need familiarity with the external service’s APIs.






## Terminology 

Let's make sure our terms are aligned before we get started.

| Term              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| SPI               | Service Provider Interface. A type of API that defines a service, but leaves the implementation of that service to Service Providers. <br> For example, to calculate shipping costs for a customer's order, Wix eCommerce calls the Shipping Rates SPI endpoint `getShippingRates()` and passes an 'options' object containing line items, shipping details, etc. The chosen service provider's implementation of `getShippingRates()` will process the infomation in the options object to calculate the applicable rates, then return an appropriately formatted object containing the information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Custom extensions | A feature that lets you extend the services provided on your site using code. You can make these extensions by adding your own custom logic into a Wix app flow, or data received from a 3rd-party into a Wix app flow. Custom extensions are implemented by adding files to backend code files to your site. These files contain code for your custom logic using SPI function calls and are triggered at specific points in the Wix app flow.                                                                                                                                      |
| Service provider  | The entity providing a service, for example, a shipping company. The service is either a Velo service or a 3rd-party service. The interface to the service is coded using Velo SPIs by the Wix user.
|
| Wix user          | You, the site owner or contributor responsible for developing the code needed for the custom extension using Velo SPIs. Your code uses your own custom logic or accesses a service provided by a 3rd-party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Service           | Any additional functionality being added to the site that is not part of the original Wix app flow. The interface to the service is coded by the Wix user with the custom extension feature using SPIs. The service can be written by the Wix user or a 3rd-party. If the service is being provided by a 3rd-party, the Wix user writes the code for the interface by [accessing 3rd-party's APIs](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-accessing-3rd-party-services-with-the-fetch-api) with [wix-fetch](/wix-fetch), and/or using [npm packages](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-accessing-3rd-party-services-with-the-fetch-api).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Wix app           | The Wix app whose functionality is being extended. For example, Wix eCommerce has several SPIs available for customizing its flows with custom extensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Implementing a custom extension with a Velo SPI 



The Custom Extensions feature currently can’t be added to a site when using Git Integration & Wix CLI (Beta).

The process of implementing an SPI in Velo has 3 steps:

1. [Create a new extension on your site](#step-1-create-a-new-extension-on-your-wix-site)
2. [Implement your extension with custom code](#step-2-implement-your-extension-with-custom-code)
3. [Deploy the extension](#step-3-deploy-the-extension)

See the [tutorial](#available-custom-extensions) for each SPI for detailed instructions. 

Need help implementing an SPI? [Find a professional](https://www.wix.com/marketplace) to help you.

### Step 1\. Create a new extension on your Wix site 

The first step in setting up your new extension is to add it to your site. This process creates a new folder in the Custom Extensions section of the Velo Sidebar that contains the files for your code.

1. If necessary, add the relevant app to your site, such as Wix Stores.
2. With [Velo Dev Mode](https://support.wix.com/en/article/getting-started-with-velo-by-wix#step-2-enable-velo-dev-mode) enabled, click the **Public & Backend** ![](https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab/76096845-8b12-44f1-91f6-3dc2e838fdd9/2022/08/29/23d50509-633d-4616-9f56-65add8fa6d0b/d910e041-d150-4f35-aa75-30ad262abc7a.png) tab on the Velo Sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the Custom Extensions panel at the bottom of the sidebar.
4. Hover over **Custom Extensions** and click **Add an integration** ![](https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab/76096845-8b12-44f1-91f6-3dc2e838fdd9/2022/08/29/badbd3b0-193b-4ada-b213-dc3233752d5c/7dca33d4-2b2d-4d12-9082-bafdf7ca5440.png).
5. Select the extension you want to add.
6. Follow the prompts to add the extension and accept any terms and conditions that display.
7. Enter a name for your integration and click **Add & Edit Code**. The name can't contain spaces or special characters.

### Step 2\. Implement your extension with custom code 

The procedure in the previous step creates a folder in the Custom Extensions section of the Velo Sidebar. The name of the folder is based on the extension you chose. Inside this is another folder with the name of the extension you set up. This folder contains 2 files, `<my-extension-name>.js` and `<my-extension-name>-config.js`. 

Default extension files:

* `<my-extension-name>.js`: The code in this file generally defines a function named after the purpose of the custom extension, such as `getShippingRates()` or `getFees()`. The function is called by Wix to retrieve the data provided by your extension.
* `<my-extension-name>-config.js`: The code in this file generally defines a function that returns an object containing values used to configure your extension.

<!-- Default extension files: + \`<my-extension-name>.js\`: The code in this file generally defines a function named after the purpose of the custom extension, such as \`getShippingRates()\` or \`getFees()\`. The function is called by Wix to retrieve the data provided by your extension. + \`<my-extension-name>-config.js\`: The code in this file generally defines a function that returns an object containing values used to configure your extension. -->

Implement the custom code for your extension in these files. See the SPI tutorial for each [supported custom extension](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-custom-business-app-extensions-using-spis-beta#available-custom-extensions-beta) for guidelines for writing your code.

**Add more files to an extension**

If you don't want to keep all of your code in the main files, you can add files to the extension's folder and import functions and objects into the main files.

1. Hover over the extension folder's name and click **Show More** ![](https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab/76096845-8b12-44f1-91f6-3dc2e838fdd9/2022/09/04/45269098-373f-4d2c-8168-2fc5242c6024/c890c6a3-6762-4501-bdb4-e44c678108df.png).
2. Select the **New.js** file.
3. To import from these files to the main files, use the following syntax:

```
import { functionName } from './myFileName.js';
```

**Test an extension**

You can test your extension before publishing your site using [functional testing](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-functional-testing-in-the-backend) like you would any backend Velo code. Make sure your functions' return values are properly formatted. To test your extension after deploying, add console logs to your code. The results appear in the [Site Events log](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-site-monitoring).

<!-- You can test your extension before publishing your site using \[functional testing\](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-functional-testing-in-the-backend) like you would any backend Velo code. Make sure your functions' return values are properly formatted. To test your extension after deploying, add console logs to your code. The results appear in the \[Site Events log\](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-site-monitoring). -->

### Step 3\. Deploy the extension 

Once your code files are ready, publish your site to deploy the extension.
