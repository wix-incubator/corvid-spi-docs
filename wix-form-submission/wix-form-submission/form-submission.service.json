      "The Form Submission SPI [custom extension](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-custom-app-extensions-using-spis) allows site owners and collaborators to validate a site visitor's filled form. For example, you can validate whether a correct email is entered into the field.",
      "Site owners and collaborators can either write their own custom validation logic, or integrate with a 3rd-party validations provider.",
      "",
      "Wix Forms calls [`validateSubmission()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/spis/wix-ecom/ecom-validations/getvalidationviolations) to validate a site visitor's filled form.",
      "The custom validation extension code validates the request, and returns any validation violation data in a site visitor's form (using the structure provided by Wix Forms).",
      "If there aren't any validation violations, the function should return an object containing an empty array. Site visitors can see validation violations in their forms. ",

      "1. [Add the extension to your site](https://dev.wix.com/docs/develop-websites/articles/coding-with-velo/integrations/custom-extensions-spis/custom-app-extensions-using-sp-is#step-1-create-a-new-extension-on-your-wix-site).",

      "",
      "## Use Cases",
      "",
      "With the Validations SPI you can define the validations for a site form that fit your site's needs. Possible validations include:",
      " - Field validations: Check if the name contains only alphabetic characters.",
      " - Prevent duplicate submissions: Check for duplicate submissions based on certain criteria and prevent site visitors from submitting the same form multiple times.",
