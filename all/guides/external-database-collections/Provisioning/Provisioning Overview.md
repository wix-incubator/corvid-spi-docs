# Provisioning Overview

The  Provision SPI describes the endpoint and payload for provisioning API requests to your external database and the payload for their success and failure responses. 

Provision API requests occur when you initially connect your endpoint to your site or change its settings.


A response status of anything other than a 200 status will result in the configuration of the [external collection](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-adding-and-deleting-an-external-database-collection) not being saved by the Wix Editor.
